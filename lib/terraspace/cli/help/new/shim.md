## Example

    $ terraspace new shim
    A terraspace shim as been generated at /usr/local/bin/terraspace
    Please make sure that it is found in the $PATH.

    You can double check with:

        which terraspace

    You should see

        $ which terraspace
        /usr/local/bin/terraspace

    If you do not, please add /usr/local/bin to your PATH.
    You can usually do so by adding this line to ~/.bash_profile and opening a new terminal to check.

        export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/$PATH

    $
